System: Micro Event Analytics

Goal:
Capture and aggregate user interaction events with minimal overhead. Output must be queryable and observable in real time.

Core Model:
Event(type: string, timestamp: auto, metadata: json)

Key Operations:
record_event:
- Input: JSON with field "type"
- Action: Insert into Event table
- Output: status confirmation

get_stats:
- Input: none
- Aggregation: COUNT(*) grouped by type
- Output: list of {type, count}

Frontend Behavior:
- Static HTML served via template
- Dropdown selects event type
- Button dispatches event using fetch()
- setInterval polls /stats and updates DOM

Data Flow:
User → Browser → fetch POST /event → Django → SQLite
Browser → fetch GET /stats → DOM rewrite

Tradeoffs:
No batching, no async queue, no stream processor
Deliberate simplicity for clarity of ownership

Expansion Paths:
Pagination, time-based filters, persistent dashboards, WebSocket streaming
